### Instructional Design Project
#### Purpose: 
The purpose of the ID project is to implement design knowledge in a self-directed, realistic context with scaffolding from your peers and your instructor. The ID project required me to implement knowledge and skills attained throughout the course. It is a blend of planning documentation, content creation documentation, the creation of actual instructional materials and instructor guide, a formative evaluation plan, and a formative evaluation report.
