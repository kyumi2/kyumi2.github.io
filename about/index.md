## About

If I can learn it, I will teach it. I absolutely love to learn and making things easier for others to understand. My career has involved a lot of technical writing, training, and procedure mapping. From creating and governing corporate operating procedures to use case test scenarios, project management plans, instructional design materials, and facilitating multiple virtual in in class courses. I see myself continuing to teach adults within the corporate world and higher education. Please reach out with any questions or help!
