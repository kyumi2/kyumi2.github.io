### CLaims Dashboard and Database
#### Purpose: 
I’ve been able to design, develop and execute a project within my department, where I collect, transform, and visualize delivery claim data for our network distribution centers.  If there’s anything that I have taken out of this entire project, is that I absolutely love the full process of data analytics. I enjoyed collecting, cleaning, visualizing, sharing, entrance for me. I enjoyed reporting the metrics, and providing analysis into issues and concerns between our company and our third-party consultant.
